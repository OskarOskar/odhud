odhud is a custom HUD for Team Fortress 2 made by Odrengen, odhud is some of my personal favorite HUDs mixed together in one HUD.

odhud includes stuff from:
e.v.e HUD: http://code.google.com/p/eve-tf2hud/
rayshud: https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud
broeselhud: http://code.google.com/p/broeselhud/
Garm3nHUD: http://www.sdx-gaming.eu/?page_id=4097
omp/tf2hud: https://github.com/omp/tf2hud

////////////////////////HOW TO INSTALL
Figure out whether you want the Solomon or Days version, then copy that folder into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom
So for example, if you want the Solomon version, you copy the folder named "Solomon version" over to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

////////////////////////HOW TO UNINSTALL
Delete the "Solomon version" or "Days version" (depending on what version you choose) folder from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom
