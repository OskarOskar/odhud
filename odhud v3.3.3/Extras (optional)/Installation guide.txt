These are extra things for odhud, you don't need them for the HUD to function.

How to install: No health cross
------------------------
1. Install whatever HUD version you want, (Days or Solomon) then open the "No health cross" folder. Inside that folder you'll see 2 folders, Days version and Solomon version. Open up one of them, depending on wich HUD you installed.

2. You'll see a file named "HudPlayerHealth" copy that into
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Days or solomon version\resource\ui and say YES to overwrite/replace

Then you're done :)

How to install: Hit indicator
------------------------

I would strongly reccomend you to install Notepad++ http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ to make this 100 times easier.

1. Open the "Hit indicator" folder, inside that you'll see 2 files. "HudAnimations_tf" and "hudlayout"

2. Copy HudAnimations_tf and hudlayout into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Days or Solomon version\scripts
and say YES to overwtire/replace

3. Open up TF2 and shoot an enemy, if the little red ring is centered, you're done. If it's not, go to step 4.

4. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\Days or Solomon version\scripts and open "hudlayout" with notepad++
You can do this with the default Windows notepad, but Notepad++ (free) makes it 100 times easier.

5. Find the section named "Hitmarker". (You can search for it by pressing control + f  in Notepad ++)

6. You'll see "xpos" and "ypos" says "c-25" and "c-23" you'll need to play around with these numbers to get the hitmarker centered.
So for example, try changing "c-23" to "c-20" go into TF2, open up the console and type "hud_reloadscheme" shoot an enemy and see if the red ring is closer to the center of the screen.
So keep playing around with the xpos and ypos until you get it right.
NOTE: YOU DON'T NEED TO RESTART TF2 EVERYTIME YOU CHANGE THE X OR YPOS, JUST TYPE "hud_reloadscheme" INTO CONSOLE. (Without the "" Of course..)
